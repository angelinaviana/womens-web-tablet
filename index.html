    <h1> Women's Web </h1>
    <p>Kelsey Toporski's compilation of feminist content, compiled while a student at the 
      <br>College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) at <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/women"> The University of Michigan</a></p>

        Growing up in a small, rural, conservative town, the Women's Studies class at LSA was really her first introduction to feminism and feminist thought, and she wanted to share her new found knowledge with others. This website is where a lot of feminist content could be compiled in one place, purely because people might not otherwise know about it. Her hometown may not have been forward thinking, but it did have an internet connection. This website currently contains 3 pages other than this one - click below to see a short description of each!
